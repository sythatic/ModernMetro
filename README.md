# Modern Metro

A refreshed rail & minecart system.

## Rails

- ### Basic Rail
- ### Service Rail (3 bps)
- ### Power Rail I (10 bps)
- ### Power Rail II (20 bps)
- ### Power Rail III (40 bps)
- ### Power Rail IV (80 Bps)
- ### Power Rail V (120 bps)

```
bps = Blocks Per Second
```

## Building Tips
> Tracks comprised of "Powered Rail II" through "Powered Rail V" should be constructed in a straight line on a flat surface.

> Use "Powered Rail I" to slow minecarts down before turning corners or changing elevation. It is currently It is not possible to turn corners or change elevation when moving faster than the vanilla Powered Rail speed (8bps).

## Planned Features & Changes

- Exchange Rail (4-way intersection)
- Accelerator Rail (Directional/one-way powered rail)
- Halting Rail (Stops a minecart in motion while still allowing forward motion)

## Minecraft Snapshot News

Recent minecraft snapshots contain experimental minecart momentum changes. This could hint at improvements to minecart movement, derailing, and speed.
